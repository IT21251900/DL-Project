# Module Name: SE4050 - Deep Learning Assignment

Project Overview
This project focuses on solving the problem of plant disease classification using the Plant Village dataset(Potato images) from Kaggle. We have developed and compared four distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify different plant diseases. This is a supervised learning task aimed at detecting and classifying plant diseases of potatos from leaf images.

Dataset
Dataset: Plant Village Dataset
Images: 54,306 images of plant leaves categorized into 38 classes (healthy and diseased).
Source: Kaggle
Preprocessing: The dataset was resized to 64x64 pixels and normalized to values between [0, 1]. Data augmentation was applied to reduce overfitting.
